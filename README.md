## Hello everyone 👋

My name is Tommy Petty (No, not that Tom Petty) and I am a developer/engineering manager at GitHub. I spent the first 18 years of my career building design automation tools for hardware engineers and custom silicon. Now, I am part of GitHub and excited to be part of a team building tools for all developers all over the 🌎!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Azure Repos and Azure Pipelines
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better developer/mentor/ally/human
- 💬 Ask me about opportunities within GitHub or how to progress your career in tech
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ❤️ to travel. When I am not working, I am most likely traveling or planning the next big trip.
